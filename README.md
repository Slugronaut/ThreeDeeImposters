# ThreeDeeImposters
Supplemental imposter system for improved performance using Three Dee Sprites.  

This system compliments [Three Dee Sprites](https://github.com/Slugronaut/ThreeDeeSprites) by creating imposters at initialization. A simple LoD script can then be used to swap between the 'live' pre-rendered sprite and the static imposter one, thus greatly reducing the number of pre-render cameras needed and vastly improving framerate.
